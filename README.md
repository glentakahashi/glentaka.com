This is the repository for my personal website.
It was built using Jekyll.

dependencies:
Jekyll 2.5.3
wkhtmltox > 0.12


## TODO

https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/
https://html5boilerplate.com/

copy linkedin style employment
use html5 boilerplate and normalize.css instead of reset.css

make links to projects much easier (i.e. show url, and blog post url)
  right now you have to do 2 cliks to see project which is too many
  maybe, automatically go to website and then show a link to non-website
