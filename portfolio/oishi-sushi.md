During Summer 2009, at COSMOS, a science/tech camp, we had 4 weeks to create a video game from scratch.
I was partnered up with someone else in my group and we came up the idea for a puzzle which we then developed in Java.

The basic story is that a young Japanese boy wants to become a sumo wrestler, but he is much too skinny.
In order to gain weight, he decides to eat lots of unhealthy food, and no healthy food.
Once he eats enough food, he can become fat enough to be a professional sumo wrestler!

Gameplay is simple, it is a kind of platform-based puzzle game, but instead of moving food around yourself, you place objects to dictate how the food will move.
Food continuously spawns from a fridge, and the goal is to get it to the boy while avoiding trash cans.
There are three different ways to control food: chutes, ladders, and walls.
Chutes cause food of the same color type to move down a platform edge, ladders cause them to move up, and walls cause them to change direction.
If an object doesn't match the food color, nothing at all will happen and it will pass right through.

If you want to give the game a try, you can download the [runnable jar](http://files.glentaka.com/oishi.jar).
