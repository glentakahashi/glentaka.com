![My Homepage]({{ page.pimg }}glentaka.png)

As with most people, personal websites are never complete.
Mine is definitely not the exception, and glentaka.com has been under construction for years. (insert 90's under construction GIF here)
However, the fact that I am always working on it means I get to use it as both a recruitment tool and a personal test bed.
I have learned a great deal of things like Sass, Jekyll, Coffeescript, SSL, load balancing, etc. just by trying them here.

Currently, I am working on updating my portfolio section with my backlog of projects and increasing the pdf generation quality.
