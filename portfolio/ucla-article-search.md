![Article Search Homepage]({{ page.pimg }}article-search.png)

One of my projects while working at Simul8 Group was to design a new article searching website that would pull articles asynchronously from databases.
My partner and I created a RESTful Python API to search articles from databases and
also made a frontend using Bootstrap, jQuery, and Knockout.js to asynchronously pull from the API.
The code is private, but you can use our website at [http://articles.uclalibrary.org](http://articles.uclalibrary.org)

Note: You will probably be unable to read the actual articles unless you are on a UCLA IP address
